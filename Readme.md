# 🔎 GraphQL Queries

## Get Available Books

```graphql
query {
  availableBooks {
    title
    available
  }
}
```

## Get Patron Borrow History

```graphql
query {
  patron(id: "PATRON_ID") {
    name
    borrows {
      book { title }
      borrowDate
      dueDate
      status
    }
  }
}
```

## Get Overdue Books

```graphql
query {
  overdueBorrows {
    book { title }
    patron { name }
    dueDate
  }
}
```

---

# ✏️ GraphQL Mutations

## Borrow Book

```graphql
mutation {
  createBorrow(input: {
    bookId: "BOOK_ID"
    patronId: "PATRON_ID"
    dueDate: "2026-03-10"
  }) {
    id
    status
    dueDate
  }
}
```

## Return Book

```graphql
mutation {
  returnBook(input: {
    borrowId: "BORROW_ID"
  }) {
    id
    status
    returnDate
  }
}
```

---

# 💰 Fine Calculation Logic

If return date > due date:

```
late_days = ceil(return_date - due_date)
fine = late_days × 10
```

Fine document is automatically created.

---

# ✅ Test Cases Covered

* Book availability updates
* Borrow reduces available copies
* Return increases copies
* Overdue detection works
* Fine generated for late return
* Patron borrowing history stored
* Author & category relationships

---
